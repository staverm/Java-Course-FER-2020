My solutions for the extracurricular java course at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing in Zagreb.


## hw01
Simple introductory problems

## hw02
- Custom collections: array indexed collection, linked list indexed collection, stack
- ComplexNumber class

## hw03 - SmartScript parser
Lexer and parser implementation for a custom scripting language SmartScript

## hw04 - Custom hashtable
Custom hashtable implementation using linked lists to resolve collisions

## hw05
